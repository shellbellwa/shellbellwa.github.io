Obituary: [Hsu Dan](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=171955355)

As a prior student of Hsu Dan, it has been such a pleasure and honor to personally learn under him.

Note: Excuse my messy writing.

As I sit here and close my eyes, I imagine the room where I spent hours and hours and hours... creating my Senior Portfolio.

Located in the walkout basement, the room is pleasantly cool during the summers and chilly during the winters; wearing winter down jackets during the winter is a must. When you enter the basement, there are a number of tables spread out with paintings he has yet to set. Some of them are already sold. I admire them, thinking how I would likely never be able to afford them... I'm happy enough with the samples and painting examples he gives me as he teaches me. An additional room juts out to the right. The door to the room is made of glass so one can see what's going on inside. He looks up from what he's doing and motions me over with a hand.

A large metal table draped with thick wool tablecloth is the centerpiece. There's a number of paintings hung on the walls: my personal favorite hung on the right side of the wall from where I sit:

Sitting at that table, with Hsu Dan on the other side, is a pretty darn cool. When you paint or draw, he nonchalantly studies your technique. Occasionally, he turns on some Chinese classical music. I have to mention though, one time he was listening to his MP3 a bit loudly and I faintly heard an MJ song. Anyways... sometimes, when he gets bored, he would end up painting the same exact thing what I was attempting to paint, and then proceed to show me what his looked like compared to mine. 

You might be thinking: "Doesn't that feel awful--knowing you may never amount to his work??" But when you know how many decades of mentoring and experience and practice this man has under his belt... I can only feel flattered that he is willing to paint at all--let alone allow me be in the same room as him. Being able to hold a brush besides a master artist like him is an honor.

The serenity he exudes when he paints makes me awe-struck. While age has deteriorated his body, his hands are so nimble and graceful. The way he's able to tastefully add that one stroke to make a painting look so... complete. 
... He's an adorable man. His wispy hairstyle gave him an elvish quality. His glasses magnified his eyes' magical quality and inquisitiveness. There's so many little things he does that makes me eager to share about to my friends when they ask me how the last art lesson was.

Let's not forget the way he smacks his lips when he is content with something. To me, that was the ultimate praise from him when he was studying my work. I remember the summer before my Senior year of high school while picking out pieces for my Senior Portfolio, he paused at the "La Voleur D'Eiffel" and immediately understood what it was... smacking his lips quietly while saying in Chinese: "How interesting... the Eiffel Tower...".

For a period of time in the beginning, he challenged us to recognize colors he mixed on his palette. Teaching us how there's hundreds of different versions of brown--"This is green/purple brown" he explained and then added a drop of red..."And this is an auburn coffee-like brown". Man, it was tough... but so worth it. Now, I find that I have developed the instinct to immediately identify what colors made up a certain hue when admiring paintings or nature.

There were times when he was frustrated with me. When I could not grasp his critique of how the greenery in the lower landscape was supposed to be laid out and I had to redo it three times, that was the loudest I ever heard him. Here's a convo I wrote down in my journals from Junior year of high school: "Calm down! Breathe! Think!" he scolded. "Art is not just emotions! You need to use your brain in combination with feelings! Art requires precision and thoughtfulness! You can't just draw out landscapes and stick things here and there!"

One time his wife brought down some carrot puree drink infused with various vegetables, telling me how he loved drinking it. Once she left, he chuckled and confided that it tasted awful, but it made her happy that she was making something healthy for him. He drank the green/orange pulp through a straw with a twinkle in his eye.

For the first Christmas, my sister and I gave him an extremely large and tall snow-globe shaped in a snowman. Don't ask... haha. Opening up the gift from the package immediately, he held the heavy object and thoughtfully studied it. Setting it right in the middle of the table, he stood up and looked at it like as if he was looking at Michelangelo. Smacking his lips once again, he nodded, saying it was very good... very good (imagine an old man voice saying this in Chinese).

For the third Christmas, my sister and I gave him... a festive dinner plate. Once again, he studied it carefully, flipping over the ceramic and studying the grain. He proceeded to put some of his brushes in the plate and then smacked his lips and nodded silently at the plate for 10 second or so. "What do you think?" he asked.

His distinctive trait was his state of constant serenity. Worries never really seemed to bother him, and he always had such a peaceful demeanor. As someone who allows my emotions to bubble over and overwhelm myself, I greatly admired how at peace he was--the Lord gave him this peace, and I yearn to be like that similarly. Father God, may you continue to challenge me with experiences in my life in order to learn to find peace and comfort only in you.

The last time I heard news about him was when my mother mentioned a chance encounter with Hsu Dan. While my father was receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, they unexpectedly met Hsu Dan in the hospital. Smaller and weaker, my parents found out that like all patients there, he was battling cancer. Unfortunately, they caught it at a later stage, but were trying their best to combat it. When my mother informed me, I was distraught. Weren't artists known for their exceptional mental fitness and longevity? Master Hsu soon recovered to return back home and begin teaching again; my sister reported to me how he seemed to be back to normal--slightly thinner and weaker, but still the same. He had surgery and he was... supposedly... okay now.

Getting the phone call last week only reminded me how saying one has "won" over cancer should be said... with caution. Like my dear 4th grade teacher, while she "won" over breast cancer, it relapsed and took her away a couple years later.

He always constantly told us how previous students-once they leave for college-would typically never bother to go back and visit him. He explains how in China, students of well-known artists had parent-child relationships. He lamented that here in America, this kind of respect is nonexistent. Sensing the sorrow in his voice, at that time, I thought to myself: "I will never be one of those people. Surely, I will visit him when I'm back home on breaks." 

I regret to say I am part of that group. 

This has taught me to hold on to relationships I have built up in my meager 20 years tightly. Life is fleeting and quick--heck, 10 more years and I'll be 30... wow. I must learn to stay in contact with people and continue building up the relationships I have built up. Laziness or business is NOT AN OPTION. Every single connection I made and will make is precious. God placed these people in my life for His reasons, and I must not take all relationships for granted.

While this time is a period of sorrow, by knowing the fact that he is baptized and saved, I can rejoice with the hope that he is with our Heavenly Father. He has defined much of my high school extracurricular experience, and I am thankful for all that he has taught me. While I may not become an artist, the skills and lessons Master Hsu has helped hone some valuable skills that I will dutifully apply in whatever work I pursue. But ultimately, he has taught me how to slow down from my busyness and to take the time to contemplate and appreciate the wonders God has created in this world, whether it be through nature or design.

Thank you.
