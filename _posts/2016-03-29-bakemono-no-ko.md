> "The latest feature film from award-winning Japanese director Mamoru Hosoda (Summer Wars, Wolf Children): When Kyuta, a young orphan living on the streets of Shibuya, stumbles into a fantastic world of beasts, he’s taken in by Kumatetsu, a gruff, rough-around-the-edges warrior beast who’s been searching for the perfect apprentice. Despite their constant bickering, Kyuta and Kumatetsu begin training together and slowly form a bond as surrogate father and son. But when a deep darkness threatens to throw the human and beast worlds into chaos, the strong bond between this unlikely pair will be put to the ultimate test—a final showdown that will only be won if the two can finally work together using all of their combined strength and courage."

In 2015 I was excitedly anticipating the premiere of バケモノの子, as Wolf Children, Summer Wars, or TGWLTT -- all directed by  細田 守 (Mamoru Hosoda) -- really left me a good impression. I didn't really have high expectations coming in, and I think that made my experience watching it for the first time even better.

Plot-wise... eh. It was not that strong. There were some questionable holes , especially when the film began transitioning storytelling between the two worlds when the main character grew up, but the beautifully detailed animation kept me from being too critical while watching. Thematically, there were elements I think the writers were definitely trying to imbue into the story, such as the theme of darkness hidden in the human heart (especially with the shading and color palette), but by the end they never really hit the mark, and it didn't satisfy my hunger for deeper introspection. There was this idea of flawed beings (whether beast or human) and a mutual teaching/learning relationship between the two main characters, which was quite endearing. What ultimately made me bawl (which is a rarity) was the love and sacrifice that was depicted in the last 30 minutes or so of the movie. I can't go into much more detail for the sake of keeping the ending a secret, but the ending made me reflect about the people who love me, as well as my faith.

Some other random tidbits. As I stopped myself from looking at movie posters or film screenshots or summaries online, the rabbit was a great surprise for me. The rabbit fan I am, I was ecstatic. Surely, the writers acknowledge the strength of these wonderful furry creatures. I was also struck by how well the artists were able to seamlessly connect the beast world with the human world, and it truly felt like reality. Their use of transparency and varying color palettes and filters between the two worlds made it so much more magical when they both meshed together. It was gorgeous.

I would definitely recommend this film! I did not watch the English dubbed version, so I cannot say whether that version was good or bad.
