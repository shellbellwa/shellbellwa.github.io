```poem
It terribly frightens me

how lacking I am

in empathy towards news of tragedy

only until

tragedy strikes close to home.

While the news ticker proclaims

of the drowned

of the found

of the proclaimed

the dead

I point my finger towards brokenness and chaos

and proclaim of our hope in God.

Words are many
and actions are few.

But when something happens to someone

so close,
so dear,
and precious to me

the tears

blot out

words

and my emotions spur me to action.

This is a constant, perpetual cycle

and this terribly frightens me
