> In his fifties, Michael Gates Gill had it all: a mansion in the suburbs, a wife and loving children, a six-figure salary, and an Ivy League education. But in a few short years, he lost his job, got divorced, and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. With no money or health insurance, he was forced to get a job at Starbucks. Having gone from power lunches to scrubbing toilets, from being served to serving, Michael was a true fish out of water.
>
> But fate brings an unexpected teacher into his life who opens his eyes to what living well really looks like. The two seem to have nothing in common: She is a young African American, the daughter of a drug addict; he is used to being the boss but reports to her now. For the first time in his life he experiences being a member of a minority trying hard to survive in a challenging new job. He learns the value of hard work and humility, as well as what it truly means to respect another person.
>
> Behind the scenes at one of Americaâ€™s most intriguing businesses, an inspiring friendship is born, a family begins to heal, and, thanks to his unlikely mentor, Michael Gill at last experiences a sense of self-worth and happiness he has never known before.

Feel-good story, eh?

I guess that's what I hoped when I decided to read it, especially when there's talk of Tom Hanks playing Mike in a possible movie adaption later down the road. 

It's a 2-4 hour read depending on how much you want to reflect on each chapter. I found it read similarly to Albom's work -- possibly Gill's reporter-like writing was influenced by his father, late New Yorker writer Brendan Gill?

I haven't been getting enough sleep these past 2 weeks so I have been terribly, terribly, lazy. And when I become lazy, I tend to write in bullets. It gives me an excuse to transition from one thought to the next without considering the fluidity of the paragraph or worrying whether or not the entire piece is cohesive when read from beginning to end... BAHA. So now you know.

## The Good

- In this memoir Mike sprinkles in flashbacks of times when he interacted with literary giants, such as Papa aka Hemingway or E.B. White, and other figures like Ali and Jackie O.  I found it fascinating reading about this guy in the dumps meeting people like them in his youth.
- Watching Mike discover happiness in a place he probably would have never expected. As head honcho in the advertising industry, he is the perfect example of the horrors of work-life balance. Placing his job over his family, Mike was willing to follow wherever JWT pointed at, whether it was across the country or traveling on Christmas morning. Ultimately, his obsession with climbing the ranks reminds myself that career and occupational recognition comes with a price--and I should tread carefully.
- Seeing that Mike is able to overcome his ego and be willing to scrub grimy Starbucks bathrooms and serve coffee to fellow colleagues. The way Mike worded the conversations and interactions made me vicariously feel the awkwardness and initial embarrassment there 
- Mike made the point of reminding readers that yes, he was able to find good in a working-class job and was the happiest he has been in years, but this should NOT take away from the fact that he made some pretty horrible mistakes.

## The Iffy

- Starbucks PR. Sometimes, I felt like Mike was just reading off of the Starbucks mission statement or the Starbucks employee satisfaction page. In my Organizational Behavior class last semester, my team (Golden Eagles on the Warpath ftw) presented a case report of Starbucks and researched their employee hiring process & training as well as looking into many lawsuits of discrimination filed against the company in the past couple of years. After scouring Starbucks documents for weeks for that project, it felt strange that I was getting a similar vibe when reading this supposed memoir. Maybe Starbucks really lives up to their words? Or was Mike paid? Who knows--let's just give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume that Starbucks was a lifesaver that provided him full-coverage insurance, an amazing and respectful work environment, and OH--we can't forget the stock options that Mike reinforces more than once in the book.
- The ending. It felt way too abrupt when Mike makes the difficult decision to leave the Broadway store in exchange for shorter commute. The tearful goodbye by his fellow partners was sweet and the prayer they wrote out to him was heartwarming, but it went way too quickly for me. Also, I'm curious: did the new store exemplify the respect the Broadway store manager enforced? Were employees smiling and engaging in small talk (which I have personally never experienced)?

Overall, this book was... alright. It was not amazing... I personally do not find why this book would be a best-seller... possibly the plot? Movie-adaption-wise, I can see this trailer becoming this heart-warming tale with similar vibes to Freedom Writers.

Happy Reading!
