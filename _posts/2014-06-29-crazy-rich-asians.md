> “Crazy Rich Asians is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.
When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn’t know is that Nick’s family home happens to look like a palace, that she’ll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia’s most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick’s formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should—and should not—marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider’s look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich.”

This is a fast, fast read. Thus, in retaliation, this will be a brief, brief, review. For me, I plopped down on my bed and finished it in 4-5 hours. It’s not dense at all—perhaps covering a topic like this it was only befitting.

Despite the outrageous descriptions of opulent mansions, expensive fashion choices, and bourgeois social lives, I have to say the characters seem quite realistic from my own experience of rich international students attending college in the States. At first, I was surprised that the author was male (considering the gold sparkly cover…ugh stereotyping), but one could tell that the male characters in the novel had more character development compared to the female characters.

I found myself silently laughing and scoffing with each page, but like any Asian drama wrapped around the idea of the rich and wealthy (Boys over Flowers, Ouran High School Host Club, Heirs), or even the BBC drama Downton Abbey, what made them so popular was the thought of “what if”—vicariously living through these made-up characters that seemingly look like they have everything they want from this world. Kwan makes the point of portraying the unhappy and unfortunate lives these seemingly “have-it-all” individuals live; it’s just a constant reminder that material things can never fill the empty void.

Right after reading this novel, I proceeded to reread Ecclesiastes to bring myself back to reality and the truth—I would recommend for you to do the same if you’re like me who gets sucked up in these fantastic settings that seem too good to be true haha.

Perhaps it is because the author is male…but I was pleasantly relieved that the novel was not blatantly chickflick-like and the book was not romantic at all—which may disappoint those Spark fans lol. It was exactly what I was looking for—a view into the lives of the growing community of upper class in Asia, with a witty and satirical narration to keep me interested.

Anyways, reading this book from a Christian POV, what made me disappointed was the realization of the thought of Christianity being considered “elite” among certain rich Asian community w/ ties to Europe (hence areas Singapore or HK). As depicted in the novel, the Asian Stepford wives would hold weekly bible study lessons, which in actuality were an outlet for the women to gossip and back-stab fellow families. Sunday Services are more of a place for people to dress their best and show off their philanthropy. Kwan depicts the irony in the families wanting to express humility while refusing their children to marry certain indidviduals who seem “uncivilized” or “lower-class”. I definitely agree with this phenomenon and am not at all criticizing Kwan for depicting it as it is; it just makes me disgruntled that God is more like another ornament or badge the elite can place on their mantel. Despite being the lowly middle-class baha, it also made me think while I may judge the super-rich, I am just as likely to make the same exact pitfalls as these characters; sure, I may not be as extreme as refusing to associate myself with a certain individual due to occupation or family history, but I am just as liable of judging and viewing myself higher, or better than someone else. As an ABC, the cultural and societal norms the characters experienced hit home with me and I found the situations posed very relevant.

All in all, it was a fun read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the growing upper class of Asian families/billionaires. Please don’t make this your go-to book for how to live life—let this be a reminder of what you SHOULD NOT be if you suddenly strike rich or if you win the lottery jackpot.

Happy reading!
