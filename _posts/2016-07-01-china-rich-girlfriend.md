Brief.

As I wrote a review two years (!!!) back for this book's predecessor, I felt the need to add my add my thoughts about it.

I read the book a month ago, so my memory and sentiments are rather hazy. But it was okay.

The plot continues off with what occurs in the first novel, and readers who felt they were left hanging will surely be excited to see what exciting (and once again... extravagant) events are in hand for the main protagonist. But other than that... I felt the observations Kwan made were not as.... spunky (?) and witty as Crazy Rich Asians. Maybe it's because Singapore is Kwan's home base and he has a lot more beef to simmer compared to life in Hong Kong or Mainland China. But when it comes to revealing the minute details and quirks, this novel pales in comparison. Though, I sympathize with Kwan's efforts to continue this series outside Singapore, and you can clearly tell he did do a lot of research in writing about the rich/socialite life of Mainlanders.

Yeah. I would say... read this if you didn't feel closure from the first novel, but other than that... it's not a must-read.
