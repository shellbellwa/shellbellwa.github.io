I filled this list out my high school sophomore year (2010), but thought it would be nice to update it four years later.

It's saddening how much I read in middle and even high school. Looking at my own schedule, I definitely have much more free time in college than before; back then my family was the type that pounded extracurricular activities and lessons and classes and practice and church and carpooling.

I'll update this again after another four year... that'll be 2018. O_O

Have you read more than 6 of these books? The BBC believes most people will have read only 6 of the 100 books listed here.
